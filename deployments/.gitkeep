# This file ensures the deployments/ directory is tracked by Git

The deployments/ folder stores deployment records for different networks:
- deployments/localnet.json (created when deploying to localnet)
- deployments/devnet.json (created when deploying to devnet)  
- deployments/mainnet.json (created when deploying to mainnet)

Each deployment record contains:
- Program ID
- Cluster/network information
- Deployment timestamp
- Deployer address
- Version information

This folder starts empty but gets populated automatically during deployment.
